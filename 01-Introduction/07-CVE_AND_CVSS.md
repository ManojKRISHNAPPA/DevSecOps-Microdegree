# CVE AND CVSS
1. **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a database of publicly disclosed cybersecurity
vulnerabilities. It is maintained by the **MITRE** Corporation, a nonprofit organization that provides
technical expertise to the U.S. government. Each CVE entry includes a unique identifier, a
description of the vulnerability, and information about the affected software or hardware.

2. **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)** is a standardized method for evaluating the
severity of vulnerabilities. It is designed to provide a consistent way of measuring the risk posed by
a particular vulnerability, regardless of the specific software or hardware affected.

3. **CVSS** scores are based on a number of factors including the potential impact of the vulnerability,
the likelihood that it will be exploited, and the ease with which it can be exploited. Scores range
from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity.

4. **CVSS** scores are often used to prioritize the response to vulnerabilities, with the most severe
vulnerabilities being addressed first. They are also used by security analysts and others to
compare the severity of different vulnerabilities and to understand the relative risk posed by
different vulnerabilities.

5. While performing False Positive Analysis, the severity of the incident needs be considered after
reviewing these scores by the DevSecOps Engineer

## Example:
### What is Log4j?
Log4j is a Java-based logging utility. Essentially, it helps developers track and record what's happening in their applications, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot. It's part of the Apache Logging Services project and is widely used in Java applications.

### Why Do We Need Logging?
Imagine you're building an app, and something goes wrong — maybe it crashes or behaves unexpectedly. Without logs, you wouldn't have much information to figure out what went wrong or where it happened. That's where logging comes in. Logging records details about your application's execution, such as:

-   Errors (e.g., something broke in the app)

-   Warnings (e.g., something unexpected happened, but it's not critical)

-   Info (e.g., normal operations or status messages)

-   Debug (e.g., detailed information useful for troubleshooting)

### Why Log4j Specifically?
Log4j is just one tool for handling logging, but it offers several features that make it popular:

-   **Flexibility**: You can control what kind of information gets logged, from low-level debug messages to high-level errors.

-   **Customizable Output:** Logs can be saved to files, displayed on the console, sent over a network, or even stored in a database.

-   **Performance:** Log4j is designed to be efficient, so it won't slow down your app even when you're logging a lot of information.

-   **Log Levels:** You can set different levels of logging (like ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, etc.) and choose how much detail you want at any given time.

-   **Configuration:** Log4j allows developers to easily configure how and where logs are saved, and even change the logging behavior without changing the code itself.

### In Simple Terms:
-   **Log4j** helps you keep track of what's going on in your application.

-   It provides an easy way to record messages that can help you debug problems or monitor your app.

-   It’s like a diary for your app that writes down important information and events, so you can look back at it when something goes wrong or when you want to check the app’s health.

The Log4j vulnerability that became highly critical in late 2021 is known as CVE-2021-44228, commonly referred to as Log4Shell. This vulnerability was a significant security issue in the popular Apache Log4j 2 library.

Let me break down the critical details related to the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability, including the relevant CWE, CVSS score, and the criticality:

## 1. CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) Overview
Vulnerability: The vulnerability occurs in Log4j 2 versions 2.0 to 2.14.1.

Issue: The core issue is in how Log4j handles user input. The vulnerability allows remote code execution (RCE) when a specially crafted string is logged, triggering Log4j to make network requests (via JNDI lookup) and potentially executing malicious code on the system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

## 2. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
CWE-1333: Improper Handling of Insufficiently Protected Credentials
The Log4j vulnerability is associated with improper handling of user input, leading to potential code execution.

CWE-91: XML Injection
This relates to the vulnerability in Log4j where user-controlled data can cause the library to perform unintended actions (like invoking JNDI lookups), leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.

## 3. CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
CVSS Base Score: The CVSS score for CVE-2021-44228 is 10.0 (critical).

Exploitability: High — this vulnerability is remotely exploitable (an attacker does not need to have direct access to the system).

Impact: High — an attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely, leading to complete system compromise.

Attack Vector: Network (RCE via network request).

## 4. Criticality of the Log4j Vulnerability (Log4Shell)
Severity: This vulnerability is considered highly critical because it allows remote code execution (RCE). If exploited, an attacker can take control of an affected system, which could potentially lead to a full system compromise.

Widespread Impact: Given that Log4j is used in millions of Java-based applications worldwide, this issue had a massive potential impact. The vulnerability could be triggered through simple log messages or even via user input in websites or applications that use affected versions of Log4j.

## 5. Response and Mitigation
Patches: The Apache Software Foundation released versions of Log4j that fixed the vulnerability:

2.15.0 (fixes the issue, but there was still a secondary issue)

2.16.0 (the final patch that completely removed the JNDI lookup functionality)

2.17.0 and later versions for further fixes.

## Mitigations:

Upgrade Log4j to version 2.16.0 or later.

Disable JNDI lookups by setting log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups to true.

Blocking outbound requests to untrusted servers can help prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability.

## 6. CVSS Breakdown (for CVE-2021-44228):
CVSS Base Score: 10.0 (Critical)

Attack Vector: Network

Attack Complexity: Low (Attackers can exploit it easily)

Privileges Required: None (No authentication needed)

User Interaction: None (Exploit can be triggered by the attacker alone)

### Impact:

-   Confidentiality Impact: High
-   Integrity Impact: High 
-   Availability Impact: High

### In Summary:
-   CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j.
-   CVSS Score: 10.0 (critical)
  -   CWE: CWE-1333 (Improper Handling of Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-91 (XML Injection)
  -It allows remote code execution (RCE) through specially crafted log messages. 
  - Exploitability: Can be triggered remotely without authentication.

## Impact: Full compromise of systems using vulnerable versions of Log4j.
