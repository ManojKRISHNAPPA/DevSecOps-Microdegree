## DEVSECOPS MATURITY MODEL
The DevSecOps Maturity Model is a framework that helps organizations understand and improve their
DevSecOps practices. It defines a set of best practices and capabilities that organizations can strive to
achieve in order to improve the security and quality of their software development and delivery processes.
There are several versions of the DevSecOps Maturity Model, but they generally include the following

## stages:
1.  **Ad Hoc:** In this initial stage, security is an afterthought and is not integrated into the software
development process.
2.  **Repeatable:** In this stage, security practices are established, but they are still separate from the
software development process.
3.  **Defined:** In this stage, security practices are integrated into the software development process and are
defined in standard procedures and policies.
4.  **Managed:** In this stage, security practices are continuously monitored and optimized to improve
efficiency and effectiveness.
5. **Optimizing:** In this final stage, security practices are continuously improved and adapted to meet the
evolving needs of the organization. 

Each stage represents an increase in the level of integration and automation of security practices into the
software development process. As organizations progress through the stages, they are able to deliver
software more quickly and with higher security and quality.
